Create an HTTP server in Python that retrieves the contents of an SSH folder, decrypts the encrypted file, and saves it to a folder on our PC. Then, upload the encrypted file to FTP, indicating the content of the decrypted file. Finally, send an SMTP email from our email address to the server at profe.ejercicio@gmail.com, specifying the decrypted file in the body of the message:
SSH at 192.168.1.123:2222
user: tresdos
password: tresdos
The path to the files is in /home
